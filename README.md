# Online-Travel-Reservation-System-Design

## Instroduction
In this project, I designed and implemented a relational database system to support the operations of an online travel reservation system. I used HTML for the user interface, MySQL for the database server, and Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server. 
 
I used virtual machine with a web server that host my web application as well as a MySQL server. Everything is under the AWS (Amazon Web Services). 

The basic idea behind this on-line travel reservation system is that it allows customers to use the web to browse/search the contents of your database and to make flight reservations over the web. The web site allows users to make both domestic and international reservations. It also allows users to query the database for available flights (direct or with stops) between a pair of cities for a given date and "approximate" time.
